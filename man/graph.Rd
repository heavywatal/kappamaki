as_igraph(.tbl)

}
\arguments{
\item{.tbl}{result tibble}

\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{mode}{Character string, \dQuote{out} for out-degree, \dQuote{in} for
in-degree or \dQuote{total} for the sum of the two. For undirected graphs
this argument is ignored. \dQuote{all} is a synonym of \dQuote{total}.}

\description{
convert result to igraph

return vertices with zero degree

find kinship below given order
}
